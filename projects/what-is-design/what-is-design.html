                <h5>Deference</h5>
                <div class="view hold-p">
                    <p>The most important question in design is: what lasts and why? When you look at Braun’s enormous
                        range of well-designed products, you’ll find that a majority of them have stood the test of
                        time. That’s because its Bauhaus aesthetic humbly submits to and respects one’s visual and
                        physical environment: enclosures feature neutral tones, with saturated hues creating
                        counterpoints that indicate function; handles make products easy to touch and move; and
                        proportional forms make products easy to scan.</p>
                    <p>Throughout Braun’s work, there is a persistent respect for customer self-expression and
                        pre-existing behavioral systems, imposing orientation only as much as it builds clarity between
                        people and their tools. But deference for people is not
                        inevitable. It is an untiring effort, never more than one design away from eradication.</p>

                <h5>Clarity</h5>
                <div class="view hold-p">
                    <p>Braun’s products are consistent, coherent, and easy to learn, which makes an honest relationship
                        with people possible. Material, color, form, and proportion are reliable indicators of function,
                        simplifying complex systems into essential, parseable components of a larger whole. </p>
                    <p>Clarity is tied directly to perceived agency: the more you understand how something works, the
                        more you can negotiate with it. Knowing the existing components of a mixer gives you ideas on
                        how to improve them, to know what is missing and what should be there.</p>

                    <p>A curated palette of neutrals and color counterpoints, well-defined proportions that build
                        ecosystem cohesion, and high-contrast controls that communicates state
                        from a distance all reinforce fluency.</p>

                    <p>Its utility is purely psychological. But once you experience simplicity and get a sense that

                        of an experience, from software and hardware to marketing and services, uniquely positions them
                        to nurture, apply, and execute imagination in the most creative ways.</p>

                        nearby and easy to get to.</p>
                    <p>Apple’s services, from Maps to Fitness, feature enough personality to make them instantly
                        recognizable across devices, reducing friction. Consistency across typography, color,
                        proportion, motion, flow, and interaction techniques and input support continuity.</p>

                        to make the right call for the right reasons.</p>
                    <p>Ownership of the experience grants one the responsibility to go beyond the obvious alternatives
                        and ship experiences that speak to the best of the arts and sciences. It’s that care for our
                        humanity that forces Apple to consider scenarios where your content reflects in the ripples of
                        pond water or where notifications tap your wrist with organic friendliness.</p>
